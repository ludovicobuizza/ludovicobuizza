# Hi there 👋
I'm Ludo, and I'm an MSc AI student at Imperial College London. 

# About me
📖 Before my masters I worked for a few years in strategy and as a founder; before then I was studying for an MSci in Physics. 

🧠 I'm super interested in the applications of AI to health and climate, and I've spent the last year getting a solid grounding in AI. I'm just getting started with my transition to being an engineer and I am very excited to start working in the field!

💻 I mainly use Python.

⛰️ Outside of tech, I am a keen amateur pianist and generally enjoy being outside.
